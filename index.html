          <p id="disclaimer"><small><em>Disclaimer:</em> Absolutely no one calls me this except for myself and maybe one other person but I think it's kinda alpha and wish they did.</small></p>
          <p id="readMorePar">I have trouble sleeping at night partly because I can't stop (over)thinking, but mostly because I'm inventing, solving, or rehearsing what I deem will be the "NEXT BIG THING!" I consider myself resolute, empowering, imaginative and a witty Rich Man.</p>

          <p>I was born and raised Mari&aacuten Sina&iacute Abuhazi Zambrano in Caracas, Venezuela, but somehow I lost a couple of names and tildes after migrating to the US in 2010. I am now plain ole Marian Abuhazi, a first-year Computer Science student
            at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science. Being the first in my family to attend college comes with a big weight and big dreams. Many dreams I am just starting to discover and others I am determined to achieve at the moment. I'm always down
          for a challenge and don't fear much except for school shootings, being tricked into Scientology, and drowning. I have a variety of interests in STEM, the arts, and areas I can't quite categorize. I have acted, swam, figure skated, played the viola for 7 years,
          coded, competed in history bowls, ran clubs, tutored and more. Talk about some range. New, challenging, fun? I'll do it.

          Growing up in a low-income immigrant household, and raised by a single mother, my whole life has been about seizing every opportunity and tackling financial challenges. It has been about using one's priviledge and power to make
          a positive impact in other people's lives and that is something my family has been really successful at and it is a goal I set out to accomplish daily.
          I am a dreamer, a hard worker and a people's person. I thrive off of any activity that involves engagement, collaboration, and chatting. Love to talk, make people laugh and help others become
          the best version of themselves as I work on my own ambitions and strive to become someone my younger self would be proud of.
