  <p>No I won't. I'm Latina and clearly that translates to: "I'll be ready in half an hour if you're lucky". Also I was raised by my momma and she's queen of running late. I am most likely just starting to fill in my brows and apply the <em>first</em> coat of mascara. It don't matter though because a queen is never late, everyone else is simply early. </p>
